		custom fbx animation might block the movement, character might not moving anymore.
		this movement animset will play, but character won't moving.
		did lot more try. never make fbx animtion to moving.
		I guess is something missing in fbx, the character moving is by the animation X file.
		not by java or lua code. which is don't know yet.
